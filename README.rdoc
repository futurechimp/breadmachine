== Glossary

The terminology surrounding credit card payment systems is arcane and can cause
a lot of confusion.  Here are some terms you might need to be familiar with:

=== 3-D Secure

The glorious credit card fraud prevention scheme incorporating {Verified by Visa}[http://www.visaeurope.com/merchant/handlingvisapayments/cardnotpresent/verifiedbyvisa.jsp] and {MasterCard SecureCode}[http://www.mastercard.com/us/personal/en/cardholderservices/securecode/index.html].

=== ACS

Access Control Server: The 3-D secure authentication server for the user's card issuing bank

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
  bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
